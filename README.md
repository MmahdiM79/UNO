# UNO (card game)

The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robbins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois.
In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.

This was my AP(Advance Programming) course project of my university second semester 2019 - 2020 (1398 - 1399). It is a simple implementation of the Othollo game in Java (without GUI). 



## Installation

Just download the file of classes, put them on a same directory(a same folder).



## Usage

compile them(you must have JDK(Java Development Kit) on your system. you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html)) and then run the Run class.


comile step:
```bash
$ javac *.java
```
start the game:
```bash
$ java Run
```

WARNNIG: for a colorfull output in terminal, I used ANSI codes and some emojis. So you can't compile and run it on Windows OS.



## Contributing
This project has a simple AI (int Bot class. just choose the first selectable card) and dosen't have GUI. 
So pull requests are welcome for this parts or other changes that make it better
